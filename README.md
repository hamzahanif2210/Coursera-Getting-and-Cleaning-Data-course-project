# Coursera-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-course-project

This repository was built for the course project of the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course at Coursera.  This is the third module in the Data Science specialization.

## Project Summary

The goal of this project is to create a tidy data data set 

The following steps are taken to transform the data into something that can be understood easily.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to form one data set.
2. Extracts only those measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. Creates a new tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
